## Client

Please open the 'client' folder for more description. This contains all the code that should run when the repository is downloaded.

## Server

The 'server' folder contains code for a backend server used to host private API keys needed to make the project work correctly. It is currently hosted on my own server on Microsoft Azure, hence you will only need to run 'client' and everything works!
